# My Personal Website
Hi, if you're looking for my website, it should be at
[https://joelt.io](https://joelt.io), not here.

If you're interested to see what my code looks like, please don't look here.
I spend most of my time working on other projects and I care more about other
projects than my personal website. Hence, you will notice that this website
almost identical to the gatsby blog template.
