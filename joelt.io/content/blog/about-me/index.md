Hi, I am Joel. I develop software and think about math. My
experience is quite diverse, I have tried machine learning, web
development, mobile development, desktop app development and much
of AWS cloud. But of course, "tried" can also mean "I tried it for
a day". Here, "try" means that I have at least done a project with
it.

I am currently studying but I have a bunch of projects I do on the
side. This website showcases my favourite projects and some
thoughts I have on math and software. Though, the main reason why I
have this website is just so that I can make use of the amazing
domain name.
