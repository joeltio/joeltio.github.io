title: Bento Box 
dateStr: Oct 2020
description: Bento Box is a simulation engine for reinforcement learning applications. It aims to speed up simulations written in Python by delegating execution to a C++ engine. This was my capstone project done with two others in my last year at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I was responsible for the C++ engine.
