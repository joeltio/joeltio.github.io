title: Focas Web
dateStr: 4-5 Mar 2017
description: Focas was a hackathon project that helps you focus on what you need to do. You just need to visit the webpage, sign in, and do your work. If you leave the webpage or tab out, it will post a facebook status that you are slacking off. This idea was inspired by (and made with) James Lim's (jameslim.com) Focas app idea.
