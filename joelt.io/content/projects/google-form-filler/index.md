title: Google Form Filler
dateStr: Feb 2019
description: In my secondary school days, there was a week where we would evaluate our teachers with a fixed questionnaire over the span of 2 weeks. Once we were done, we could do our own work until everyone was done. So, since the questions were the same, I wrote a program to fill the Google Forms for me once the forms were opened.
