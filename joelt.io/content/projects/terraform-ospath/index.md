title: Youtube Rewind Dislikes Graph
dateStr: Jan 2019
description: In Jan 2019, I had to make something for my school's open house. At that time, YouTube rewind was getting a lot of hate and a lot of people were disliking the video. So, I made a graph of the dislikes using Python turtle (I had to show how turtle was fun).
