Though for the first day I was trying to fix the byte-social-media, I was still able to write the code needed to link the Android application to Firebase. I have also changed the code to use Android architecture components.<br/><br/>During the process, I found out that Android also has architecture components for navigation. It was very interesting as Android had always had a clunky navigation system where developers just send intents here and there to start new activities. The navigation architecture component provides a central storyboard on the flow of the application (which I think XCode has had for quite a while now).<br/><br/>Moving forward, I hope that my teammates would be able to learn these things as they do make life much easier at the cost of the initial learning curve."
