    "content": "<img src='posts/retrospective.jpg' />Last week, we had a sprint retrospective meeting to review how we felt about the project, problems and create action plans to fix those problems.<br/><br/>I think the main issue that we face was that we did not have a concrete idea of what the app will look like and even if we did, each of us has a different idea of what it will look like. To fix this problem, we have decided to add designing as a task. Other tasks which depend on this design task cannot be done until the design task has been done and checked by another person."
