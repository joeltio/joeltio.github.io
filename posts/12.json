    "content": "This week, FSD covers more about testing and how it is applied in development. Previously, I thought that TDD was <i>the</i> thing to do when developing. However, when I was working at a company, I realised that writing tests for all code is very tedious especially when you are unsure of how the code should look like. This is especially so for testing frontend. Usually when I develop the frontend, I will experiment with different layouts and will refactor intensively, however, writing selenium code to continually test the frontend did not help me much in the refactoring process. In fact, majority of my time was spent on refactoring the test code instead of refactoring the actual code. I think that selenium testing should really come in only after the design is quite settled and things rarely change. In the meantime, using a testing tools for the frontend framework will offer much more benefit at lower cost of refactoring.<br/><br/>As of now, I do not fully believe in TDD, I believe that there should be a balance: some code is trivial and do not need tests, others can be complex and tests ensure that you do not miss anything."
